    <h2>Music and Baile</h2>
    <p>For travelers craving culture with a heartbeat, Cuba offers an unforgettable music and dance experience woven into its cities, streets, and sunsets. In Havana, live bands serenade guests in open-air casas de la música, while dancers ignite the stage with passionate salsa and rumba—a must-see at the legendary Tropicana cabaret. Over in Trinidad, cobblestone squares come alive as locals and visitors groove to infectious rhythms in spontaneous street parties.

Interested in learning the moves? Many resorts and cultural centers offer dance workshops led by local pros who’ll get you spinning in no time. Music lovers should also visit Santiago de Cuba, the birthplace of son cubano, for vibrant festivals like the July Festival del Caribe, where performances flood the city with color and soul.

Whether you join a dance circle or just tap your toes with a mojito in hand, Cuba’s musical spirit wraps around you, turning every moment into a celebration.</p>

<h2>Traditional Cuban Music</h2>
    <p> Cuba’s musical roots run deep, shaped by centuries of African and Spanish influence that gave rise to iconic genres like son cubano, danzón, bolero, and rumba. These styles blend poetic lyrics, syncopated rhythms, and vibrant instrumentation—think tres guitars, conga drums, and maracas—to create a sound that’s unmistakably Cuban.

Legendary artists like Beny Moré, known for his velvety voice and timeless boleros, and Compay Segundo, whose song Chan Chan became a global anthem through the Buena Vista Social Club, helped define Cuba’s musical identity. Other classics like Guantanamera and Lágrimas Negras continue to echo through plazas and patios, connecting generations through melody.

Whether performed in a quiet courtyard or a lively casa de la trova, traditional Cuban music is more than entertainment—it’s a living archive of the island’s history, spirit, and pride. </p>
